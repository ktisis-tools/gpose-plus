# Ktisis/GPose+

This project is a learning exercise in Reverse Engineering and DirectX rendering.
It runs via code injection.

The end goal is to expand the features of FFXIV's Group Pose mode and provide a workspace for posers.

Focus on plugin development has been moved [HERE](https://github.com/ktisis-tools/Ktisis).
