# Ktisis/GPose+

This project is a learning exercise in reverse engineering and DirectX rendering.
It is a mod for the game that runs via code injection.

The end goal is to expand the features of FFXIV's Group Pose mode and provide a workspace for posers.

#### List of target features, in order of complexity (ascending):
- [ ] 2D Overlay
- [ ] Free camera movement
- [ ] Save and load different camera positions
- [ ] In-game manipulation of actor and bone positions/rotations

#### Features that I would like to explore, but are not currently a priority:
- Timeline editor
- Rendering of 3D props ingame
